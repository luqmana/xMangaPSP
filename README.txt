To Build
--------

OneMangaPSP can be built on any platform which supports the PSPSDK and the required libraries. So far building has been tested on:
	- Windows XP [Minimalist PSPSDK]
	- Windows Vista [Minimalist PSPSDK]
	- Ubuntu [64-bit] [SVN PSPToolchain + libs]
	- Ubuntu [64-bit] [Minimalist PSPSDK]
	
For a onestop solution I recommend Minimalist PSPSDK which installs the PSPSDK and the required libraries plus some extra ones. It is also kept up to date.

The required libraries for OneMangaPSP are as follows: [The required libraries themselves have required libraries but those are not included]
	- SDL
	- SDL_gfx
	- SDL_Image
	- SDL_Mixer
	- SDL_TTF
	- zziplib
	- curl
	- TinyXML
